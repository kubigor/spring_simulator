# spring_simulator
Imitation of water flow and gravity (BFS algorithm with stacks / GUI Kivy)

The idea for that project came to my mind when I was checking out popular projects for entry level web developer.
Particulary I was inspired by "find shortest path" and "maze solver" algorithms. Even so # spring_simulator uses only combination of BFS and stacks,
it was my pick because it's not a standard idea and a good opportunity to demonstrate deep knowledge of basic data structures and is's implementation.
Also that's my first experience of using GUI. The whole project was done in 12-16 hours.
